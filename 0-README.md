# BlockchainB
Second mini-project B for final Blockchain assignment for CSC435

So far I have implemented the simple blockchjain from part A of the assignment. Then I added a new class to hold all of the data for my blockRecord object.
My goal for part B is to be capable of marshalling data in and out of Java using the google Gson library. 

I ran into problems setting up my path variables correctly so am creating a new virtual dev envoironment on a linux VM to be able to se a clean path for my .jar files.

As of last attempt at compiling (10/15/2020), the compilation failed. My jre could not locate com.google.Gson.
